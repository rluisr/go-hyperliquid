    "log"

    "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto"
    hyperliquid "github.com/rluisr/go-hyperliquid"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize client
    client := hyperliquid.NewClient(hyperliquid.MainnetAPIURL)

    // For trading, create an Exchange with your private key
    privateKey, _ := crypto.HexToECDSA("your-private-key")
    exchange := hyperliquid.NewExchange(
        privateKey,
        hyperliquid.MainnetAPIURL,
        nil,    // Meta will be fetched automatically
        "vault-address",
        "account-address",
        nil,    // SpotMeta will be fetched automatically
    )

    // Place a limit order
    order := hyperliquid.OrderRequest{
        Coin:    "BTC",
        IsBuy:   true,
        Size:    0.1,
        LimitPx: 40000.0,
        OrderType: hyperliquid.OrderType{
            Limit: &hyperliquid.LimitOrderType{
                Tif: "Gtc",
            },
        },
    }

    resp, err := exchange.Order(order, nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Subscribe to WebSocket updates
    ws := hyperliquid.NewWebsocketClient(hyperliquid.MainnetAPIURL)
    if err := ws.Connect(context.Background()); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer ws.Close()

    // Subscribe to BTC trades
    _, err = ws.Subscribe(hyperliquid.Subscription{
        Type: "trades",
        Coin: "BTC",
    }, func(msg hyperliquid.wsMessage) {
        fmt.Printf("Trade: %+v\n", msg)
    })
